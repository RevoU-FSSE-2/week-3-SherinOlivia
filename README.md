# Hi! Welcome~
## <b>My name is Sherin Olivia, usually goes by Roo online</b> 

<p> This repository was prepared as part of the third weekly project involving advanced HTML and CSS technique such as grid, responsive image, advanced styling for image and text, css-only image carousel, dark & light mode. All of which is quite a step up from the previous week! Wish me luck! <p>

### Deployed web : <a href="https://roofanprojectv2.netlify.app/#">Roo's PTN Fanproject v2</a>

<p>As previously mentioned, this weekly project also revolves around my favourite game <strong>Path to Nowhere</strong> I truly believe that this project succesfully showcases my extra efforts--evidently with major help from the internet and fellow classmate,<strong> Kak Adri!</strong>(Thank you for tips tid bits!) in expressing my tremendous respect and fondness for a mobile game called <strong>Path to Nowhere<strong></p>

<p>In the future, I hope to continuously update or remake this fanproject as the means to check and show my progress in my learning journey to become Software Engineer! Just like I did this week!</p>
